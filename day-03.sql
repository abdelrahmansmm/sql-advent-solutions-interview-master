-- Difficulty: hard

-- Question:
-- The Grinch has brainstormed a ton of pranks for Whoville, but he only wants to keep the top prank per target, with the highest evilness score. Return the most evil prank for each target. If two pranks have the same evilness, the more recently brainstormed wins.

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: grinch_prank_ideas
--   prank_id: INTEGER
--   target_name: VARCHAR
--   prank_description: VARCHAR
--   evilness_score: INTEGER
--   created_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

WITH prank_ranks AS (
  SELECT target_name, prank_id, prank_description, evilness_score, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY target_name ORDER BY evilness_score DESC, created_at DESC)
  FROM grinch_prank_ideas
)
SELECT target_name, prank_description
FROM prank_ranks
WHERE rank = 1
