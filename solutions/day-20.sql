-- Question:
-- Jack Frost wants to review all the cocoa breaks he actually took — including the cocoa type and the location he drank it in. How would you combine the necessary tables to show each logged break with its matching cocoa details and location?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT t.cocoa_name, loc.location_name
FROM cocoa_types t
JOIN cocoa_logs l
ON t.cocoa_id = l.cocoa_id
JOIN break_schedule b
ON l.break_id = b.break_id
JOIN locations loc
ON b.location_id = loc.location_id
